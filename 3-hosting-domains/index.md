## What is Hosting?

Hosting is a service that allows you to **post a website onto the internet**. There you can have a online storage that saves the data, media files, and the content that your website needs to render. The hosting server belongs to a company provider and you search for that service.

Each time that someone access to your website the server transfer the files to complete the request.

Basically: **where your website lives**.

Now we have other point. You have to pay the rent about the place where you live. If it's bigger it would be more expensive. If it's fancy it would be expensive. And you can search for hosting providers that satisfy your website needs... such as:
 
* Number of websites.
* Bandwidth measurement.
* Storage, database.
* Mail.
* Domain.
* SSL certificate.

#### Dedicated hosting

You have your own physical server dedicated exclusively for your site. Therefore, dedicated hosting gives you incredible flexibility and reliability. 

#### Shared hosting

Here, multiple sites share the resources of the server talking about the service and the hardware. The cheapest option that would fit your beginning website. It is like Transmilenio, there are many chairs and it is paid to enter the system, but there is no guarantee of using a chair at any given time.

#### VPS hosting
 
 Virtual Private Server. You share a server with other users, however the provider assigns you a separate partition on the server. This means that you get a dedicated server space and a reserved amount of computing power and memory.

#### Cloud hosting

No downtime, it will redirect to other cluster. With cloud hosting, your provider gives you a cluster of servers. Your files and resources are replicated on each server.

| Type             |      Cost      |  Performance  | Technical knowledge | Server control |
| :---             |     :---:      |     :---:     |         :---:       |      :---:     |
| **Dedicated**    |      high      |  normal-high  |         high        |       high     |
| **Shared**       |      low       |   low-normal  |         low         |       low      |
| **VPS**          |   low-normal   |   normal-high |         high        |       high     |
| **Cloud**        |      normal    |   high        |         low         |   low-normal   |

# Domains

### What is a domain

Domains are web addresses that are used to communicate on the Internet. Once you register a domain name, you can use it as your website address or email address.

* *Domain: **pushdev.co***
* *IP: 192.168.0.18*

* Domains names were created to make IP (Internet protocol) addresses more human friendly.
* Imagine to memorize random numbers for every single website you wanted to find on the internet.

When you type www.pushdev.co in the browser the DNS (Domain Name System) will search the domain like the phone directory. Then translate the domain into the IP address, in that way computers can understand it. The same way as humans do with domains names.

When you want to call to your friend you don't search the by number, you do it by the name.

**Tips**

* Use a domain name easy to understand, spell and type. Use keywords.
* Avoid long names... make it easier.

### Extension

* Part of the domain following the dot.
* **.com** It's the most widely used extension.
* Describe your brand.

pushdev.**co**

* .net
* .org
* .info
* .biz

You can have various extensions redirecting to the same website.
