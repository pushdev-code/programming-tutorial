### What is a terminal?

The terminal is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

In the old days, you had to use the shell, there was no other option.

Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.
